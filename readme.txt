== Description ==
This plugin generates a brief retrospection of your blog for a given timeframe (only year available in first release).

See how many posts you wrote during this time, which were the most popular, who was the most active commenter etc.

And then share the stats with your readers - copy the data to a new draft with a single click.

This is a rewrite of my old  [2012 Summary Plugin](http://www.lioman.de/plugins-scripte/2012-summary "WordPress-Plugin: 2012 Summary"), which was only capable to produce a summary for the year 2012. I want to evolve it a little bit.
